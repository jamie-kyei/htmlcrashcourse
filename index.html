			It’s back. The moment you’ve all been waiting for. Been a month and a few weeks but I think I’m ready to come back to this. Nothing much has changed. I <strong>did pass my driving test</strong> at the end of <em>January</em> though. Six months of driving lessons that led up to it. I’m a grand less in wealth than I was before. But at least it’s all over now. This thing just continues to carry on though. And it’s time for the K’s. Like ‘J’, there aren’t a lot of songs to write about beginning with ‘K’ too. It just depends on how I’m feeling whether I can get these out on a regular schedule.
